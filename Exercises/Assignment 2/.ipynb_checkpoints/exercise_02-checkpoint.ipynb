    "YOUR ANSWER HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "__(a)__ Each of the variables can have either TRUE or FALSE values, which results in $2^5$ possible combinations of values. So each parameter will define the probability of each assignment. However, since $p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)$ is a probability distribution, all of the parameters must sum up to 1, reducing the degree of freedom by 1. Therefore, the number of parameters needed to define the distribution $p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)$ if no assumptions are made is $2^5 - 1$ (answer)\n",
    "\n",
    "__(b)__ We have $p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) = p(x_1) p(x_2|x_1) p(x_3|x_2) p(x_4|x_3) p(x_5|x_4)$ Since $x_1$ has no parent, it has only one degree of freedom. For the rest nodes, they all have parents so they have 2 degree of freedom. Together, there are $2^4 + 1$ number of parameters to define the distribution under this Bayesian Network (answer)\n",
    "\n",
    "__(c)__ We have $p(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) = p(x_1) p(x_2|x_1) p(x_3|x_2) p(x_4|x_3) p(x_5|x_4) = p(x_1) p(x_2|x_1)^4$. Like part (b), there is only one degree of freedom for $x_1$, but this time we only need two degree of freedoms to define the rest variables, as all probabilities are all equal. Therefore, the number of parameters to define the distribution is $2^1 + 1 = 3$ (answer)\n",
